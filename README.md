# dumacast
dumacast (former dumalogiya-vwcm): script for virtualising webcam and microphone on Linux (as Manycam does)
After installation and the first run edit configs in /etc/dumalogiya/dumacast-config.sh and $HOME/.config/dumacast/dumacast-config.sh
Config variables from $HOME/.config/dumacast/ overwrite the ones from /etc/dumalogiya/dumacast-config.sh, but they are added to them.
